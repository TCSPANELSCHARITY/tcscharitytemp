    <h2>Information </h2>
    <p class="centertext">From the 19th to the 21st of September a team of 17 from RSE TCS will be taking on a charity event challenge, consisting of 3 days of canoeing / hiking a 53 mile stretch of the Great Glen Way, from South Laggan to Inverness. Eight people will canoe while eight people walk, with swap over points along the way.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="centertext">TCS are taking on the challenge in order to raise funds for The Highland Hospice in memory of Heather Dallas and Wakefield Hospice / Croft House Care Home in memory of Sue Hurst, who sadly lost their battle with cancer this year.</p>
    <br>  
    <p class="centertext">Both hospices and the Care home provide services to people, their families and carers who are faced with life shortening illnesses, death and bereavement, to ensure all involved receive the best possible care.</p>
    <p class="centertext">Donations can be made <a href="https://www.givewheel.com/fundraising/4543/team-fundraising-for-highland-hospice-and-wakefield-hospice/">HERE</a> or accessed on this QR code</p>
